## The two portals

**Participant portal** (`/portal.html`): sign up, verify your email with the SMTP code, log in, then register your team inside the portal (team, size, college, ID, domain, problem statement, members). After that: edit details, see Pending / Approved / Rejected, announcements, timeline and countdown. Confetti on first registration.

**Admin portal** (`/admin.html`): log in with the admin account from `.env`. Tabs: Overview (teams, participants, pending/approved/rejected, sign-ups with no team, status donut, registrations per day, by domain, by team size), Registered teams (search + filters, view full details and ID card, approve / reject / delete, CSV export, auto-refresh every 30 s), Domains (add / edit / delete) and Announcements.

## 1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (free)

1. Create an account at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create a free **M0** cluster.
2. **Database Access** → Add Database User → username + password (save them).
3. **Network Access** → Add IP Address → for local testing add your IP; for Vercel add `0.0.0.0/0` (allow from anywhere).
4. **Database** → Connect → Drivers → copy the connection string. It looks like
   `mongodb+srv://USER:PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/kle-hackathon?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
   Replace `USER` and `PASSWORD`. If the password has special characters, URL-encode them.

The collections (`users`, `teams`, `domains`, `announcements`) are created automatically.

## Brevo email verification

Participants must verify their email before they can log in: sign up → a 6-digit code is emailed (valid 10 minutes, 5 tries, 60 s resend cooldown) → enter it → logged in → register the team.

Create a Brevo account, generate an API key in **Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys**, and verify the sender address/domain you want to use. Set `BREVO_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, and (optionally) `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` in your `.env` and in your deployment environment.

**Test it:** `npm run test-mail -- you@example.com` sends a test message through the Brevo transactional email API. Signup and resend fail with a clear server error if Brevo rejects the request; OTPs are not written to local logs.


```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # then edit .env
npm start                   # http://localhost:3000
```

Set these in `.env`:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Atlas connection string from step 1 |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Long random string. Generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | The first admin account, created automatically on first start |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Brevo API key used to send transactional emails |
| `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | Verified Brevo sender email and optional display name |

Pages: `/` (site), `/portal.html` (participants), `/admin.html` (admins).

## 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo (`.env` is git-ignored).
2. Vercel → Add New Project → import the repo. No build command needed.
3. Project Settings → Environment Variables: add `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `BREVO_API_KEY`, and `EMAIL_FROM` (plus optional `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`).
4. Deploy. Static files in `public/` are served directly; `/api/*` runs through `api/index.js` (see `vercel.json`).
5. In Atlas Network Access, allow `0.0.0.0/0` so Vercel can connect.

Using the CLI instead: `npm i -g vercel && vercel --prod`.

## API

## Notes

- Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs` (same algorithm as bcrypt, no native build, works on Vercel).
- ID card uploads are stored in MongoDB as base64 (limit about 1.4 MB, images or PDF). For many teams, move uploads to Cloudinary or S3.
- Participants sign up in the portal first; the team leader's email is the account email.
- Reduced-motion users get a static 3D scene; the site is responsive down to phones.
